# Reverse Engineering
## What this is about
I recently got into this subject in order to get better understanding of the buffer overflow vulnerability which is very common and complex to understand. So I started by studying Assembly x86 and taking notes that I will be sharing here to keep track of everything and maybe it could be of help to someone getting started in the field as well ðŸ˜€
